# Guide for reporting bugs

<ArticleAd />

Before **reporting a bug**, please follow these guidelines to ensure that your report is as useful as possible:

1. Search the group or forum to see if the **bug has already been reported**.
2. Try **rebooting your device** to see if this resolves the issue.
3. Perform a **clean flash** of the ROM by formatting data/factory resetting using the recommended recovery.
4. Check for the bug before installing any additional modifications, like **Magisk modules**.
5. Use the **default kernel** that came with the ROM.
6. Use the **recovery** recommended by the maintainer.

Only report bugs after you have followed all of the above mentioned guidelines

:::caution

Reports from users who have not followed these guidelines, such as **decrypted users**, users who have **changed the kernel**, or users who have not performed a **clean flash** when instructed to, may be ignored.

:::

When reporting a bug, be sure to include the following information:

- Your **device variant**
- The version of **PixelOS** you are using
- Any relevant **logs** (by reading [this guide](./howtolog)).
