# Guide to reporting bugs
* Have you searched the group to see if the bug has already been reported?
* Have you rebooted your device to see if this solves the bug?
* Did you clean flash the ROM by formatting data / factory resetting?
* Did you check for the bug before flashing any additional stuff like Magisk modules?
* Are you using the default kernel which came with the ROM?
* Are you using the default recovery that you are instructed to use?
* Did you format data / factory reset with the recovery instructed to use?

:::caution

Reports from decrypted users, users who changed kernel, users who do not use the recommended recovery and users who do not clean flash when instructed to are ignored.

:::


Please only report bugs if you can answer all questions above with yes.
While you report, please mention your device variant, ROM version, kernel version. Please provide logs too (by reading the [this guide](guides/howtolog)).
