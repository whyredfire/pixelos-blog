# Guide to reporting bugs
* Did you search the group if the bug has already been reported?
* Did you reboot your device to see if this solves the bug?
* Did you flash the rom clean with formating data (No bug reports for decrypted users)
* Did you check for the bug before flashing any additional stuff like Magisk modules?
Please only report bugs if you can answer all questions above with yes.
While you report, please mention your device variant, ROM version, kernel version. Please provide logs too (by reading the howtolog note).
