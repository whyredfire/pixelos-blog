### A note for unofficial PixelOS builders

We've pushed the CertifiedPropsOverlay template to PixelOS-AOSP/vendor_extra. You can clone it to vendor/extra and update the values as needed.

Regarding signing, we've integrated the inline signing implementation from YAAP (thanks to Ido and John), so your builds will be signed automatically. You just need to generate the private keys and place them in vendor/aosp/signing/keys/ using the following command:

```bash
subject='/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Android/OU=Android/CN=Android/emailAddress=email@example.com'
for x in releasekey platform shared media networkstack nfc verity otakey testkey sdk_sandbox bluetooth; do \
    ./development/tools/make_key vendor/aosp/signing/keys/$x "$subject"; \
done
```

where:

    C: Country code (e.g., US)
    ST: State name
    L: City name
    O: Organization name
    OU: Organizational Unit name
    CN: Common name
    emailAddress: Your email address
