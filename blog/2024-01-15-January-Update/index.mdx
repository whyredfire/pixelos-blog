### Regarding Google Play Integrity
In our last blog, we discussed an overlay solution to tackle Google Play Integrity issues. We've now rolled out an updated version of this overlay. Users can effortlessly install it, reboot their devices, and successfully pass Play Integrity checks. You can find these updates on our Telegram chat [@PixelOSChat](https://t.me/PixelOSChat) and stored as a note with the name `playintegrityfix`. 
Stay in the loop for hassle-free Google Play experiences!
