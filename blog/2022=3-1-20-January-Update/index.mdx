Welcome back after quite a long absence, the team has been extremely busy with their personal lives because of exams, scheduling, and other personal matters, 
but we’ve been working hard behind the scenes and are happy to say we’ve **made a lot of changes** and added a lot more functionality to PixelOS (some has been long requested).

The first major change isn’t apparent visually, but we’ve **rebased almost every repository** and have started tracking changes from LineageOS rather than ArrowOS 
as we were previously. Speaking of things being rebased, we’re happy to let you know that Android 13 QPR 1 has been fully merged, which brings a lot of improvements
to AOSP. 

:::info
As there have been a LOT of changes, **a clean flash will be MANDATORY FOR ALL DEVICES**.
:::

The GMS components have been **updated using the latest versions from the Pixel 7 Pro (Cheetah)**.

Finally, we’ve **improved the implementation of Smooth Display** for devices with higher refresh rate screens, which should help improve refresh rate switching 
for a smoother experience and better battery life.

Now that we’re done with the under-the-hood changes, let’s move on to the fun stuff.

Next comes some features people have been asking about for a while, and we’re glad to let you know that we’ve **introduced the option to
network usage stats in the quick settings**. You can also now **monitor how fast your connection is** with the new **real-time network speed indicator** 
available in the status bar, which will show your upload and download speeds. We’ve also **added network permissions on a per-app basis**, meaning 
you can fully restrict the access to Wi-Fi or cellular data for each and every app. 

Some additions to the quick settings tiles have been made also, with a **new hotspot toggle in the Internet menu** for quick access to turning your 
hotspot on and off. We’ve also made the **Bluetooth menu something optional and restored the original Bluetooth tile** for those who prefer a quick 
tap to turn it on and off. 

The Settings menus have had some changes to tidy things up as well, with the **combined Privacy and Security tab** seen on Pixel devices having been 
added. We’ve also **reorganised the Sound settings menu** to make things a little easier to find and navigate in a way that’s more intuitive.

A question we often get asked is “Why can’t I hide the space under the keyboard even if I turn the pill off?” Good news, you can now. We’ve **added a 
toggle to allow removing the IME space below the keyboard** for those who prefer it that way.

A pitch-black dark mode is something a lot of people really enjoy having, especially on devices with OLED displays. We’ve made **some improvements to the 
pitch-black theme** so it should be working better at applying around the UI.

A lot of people seemed to prefer the **expandable volume menu** accessible from the volume slider and missed it from PixelOS 12/12.1, some good news is that 
we’ve brought it back.

One new addition is an **ADB root toggle** in the developer options, this means you can use a built-in root alternative to Magisk that can be easily enabled 
and disabled at will without having to patch and flash your kernel.

:::caution
Enabling this option gives higher privilage, which can be easily misused. Use this feature with carefully. 
:::

**Auto rotate has now become more granular** as well, with configurable rotation angles available so you can choose from 360 rotation or can set it to only 
rotate to certain angles.

Last and far from least, one of the most requested features has been **OTA updates**, which we can gladly say has returned, meaning easier updates available 
to download and install right from the settings menu. 

In summary, the January 2023 Update PixelOS includes the following changes and updates:

- Network speed indicator for monitoring internet connection
- Organized sound settings 
- Combined privacy and security tab 
- Hide IME (input method editor) space option
- Improved smooth display implementation for devices with higher refresh rates
- Updated GMS components from the latest Pixel release
- Improved black (dark) mode
- BT dialog tile is now optional, with both custom and stock options available
- Expanded volume dialog implementation
- Hotspot toggle in quick settings internet tile
- System OTA updater for easy over-the-air updates, with the seamless updates for vAB devices
