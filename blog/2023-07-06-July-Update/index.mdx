Welcome back to another PixelOS update!
We're excited to bring you the latest update for PixelOS, packed
with new features, improvements, and fixes to enhance your experience. 

We initially aimed to release the update in July, but the release of the July patch
from Google has been slightly delayed, [due to the holidays on July 5](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1675928602485874688?s=20). 
We expect to merge the July patch once Google releases it. Stay tuned for it!

Now, let's dive into the changelog:

## Launcher Enhancements:

We have a new Wallpaper Picker UI from Android 14 and with the introduction of emoji 
wallpapers, users can now select from a collection of wallpapers featuring various emojis, 
adding a fun touch to their device's home and lock screens. 

Users can now choose what shortcuts should be displayed at the lockscreen, or choose to
disable it completely. Shortcuts include flashlight, do-not-disturb, mute button, camera, 
QR Code Scanner and more.

## Smart 5G

- Disable 5G in battery saver mode: When the device enters battery saver mode, Smart 5G automatically switches off 
5G connectivity. This helps to reduce power consumption and extend battery life during low-power situations.

- Disable 5G when not on mobile data (such as Wi-Fi): When the device is connected to Wi-Fi or any non-mobile data 
network, Smart 5G intelligently turns off 5G to avoid unnecessary battery drain. It ensures that 5G is only used 
when the device is on a mobile data network.

- Disable 5G on non-active data sim: For devices with dual SIM functionality, Smart 5G recognizes which SIM is actively 
used for data and enables 5G only on that particular SIM. For the non-active data SIM, it disables 5G to save battery 
and optimize network usage.

## GMS and Face Unlock:

- Switched to partner GMS (Google Mobile Services) to improve overall stability.

- Switched to AOSPA's face unlock implementation, providing much faster and more reliable face 
recognition.

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where the launcher in light mode would still display dark search results, 
ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing experience.

- Addressed a bug where the wallpapers section would not open from the home screen, allowing 
you to customize your device's look effortlessly.

- Fixed a rare issue where two status bars would display, eliminating any potential visual clutter.

- Made improvements to Pitch Black mode, refining the dark theme experience for better readability and aesthetics.

- Fixed an issue where Google battery widget does not update
