Android 15 QPR2 has now been merged, bringing the new Modes feature. This is an improvement on the previous Do Not Disturb function of Android, allow you to create and customise profiles for different occasions (weekends, workdays, etc.) that can be easily switched between from a Quick Settings tile.

Themed icons have been updated from AOSPA, providing themed icon support for more third party apps that haven't added their own monochrome icons yet for a much more consisten look on your home screen.

Flashlight tile colours have been fixed for devices that don't have support for controlling the brightness/intensity of the flashlight.
