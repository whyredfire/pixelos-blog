We have been constantly expanding and bringing on new devices. This however, happens at a time when the costs for renting a server have continued to rise.
Just a reminder that the CI is funded either by donations or has been out of pocket from members of the team themselves. If anyone would like to donate to
help out with the server costs, more information and donation methods can be found [here](/docs/donate)

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and a new Android version in the coming months!
