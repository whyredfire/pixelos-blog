Welcome back to another PixelOS update!
This month’s update is larger with many changes from both AOSP and our side. We’ve rebased the March QPR2 patch as well as merged the April patch. We have also rebased most of our repositories from LineageOS.

One of our biggest changes would be the launcher. We’ve heard your reports of the Pixel Launcher draining and heating devices. This [issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/11mbx0e/pixel_launcher_causing_excess_battery_drain/) seems to affect even Pixel Devices. Unfortunately, we have had to make the difficult decision to drop the Pixel Launcher in favor of the Paranoid Android Launcher for stability reasons. It still maintains the same look and feels with more customization options.

We are thrilled to announce that we have added a highly requested feature to our latest update: **AppLock**. This allows you to secure your apps with a password or biometric authentication, providing an extra layer of security for your applications.

More customization has been added with additional **icon style, font, and icon shape options** that you remember from Android 11. We have also switched our Bluetooth tile implementation that turns Bluetooth off and on with a tap and brings up a Bluetooth menu with a long press. This eliminates the need for two separate tiles.

The network indicator has been changed to a new version that fits better. Quick Settings have been made even quicker with the quick-pulldown option. A **new and improved black theme** implementation has been added to the Dark theme settings.

Finally, we’re happy to announce that **OTA updates have returned**.

In summary, the April 2023 Update PixelOS includes the following updates:

- The March/April patches have been merged
- Switched to the Paranoid Android Launcher
- Added icon styles and icon shape options
- Added ability to switch fonts
- Added over the air updates
- Added AppLock
- Use Monet colors for the power menu
- Updated the Bluetooth tile implementation
- Updates to the network traffic indicator implementation
- Updates to the Dark Mode implementation

For the people who still would prefer to use the Pixel Launcher, we have made a magisk module if you would still like to use it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/PixelOS-Releases/releases-public/releases/download/2023-04-13/PixelLauncher-13.0-20230413.zip).
