# December 2025 Update

This month’s update rebases PixelOS to the latest Android 16 QPR1 release (`android-16.0.0_0_r3`), bringing in all upstream improvements, security patches, and the platform changes included in QPR1.

Oh, and that “Android 16 feature” everyone kept asking about? Quick Settings Blur — actually a 16 QPR1 thing.
Good news: we’re on QPR1 now, so enjoy.
