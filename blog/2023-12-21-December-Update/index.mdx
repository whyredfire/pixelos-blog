Hello community! We're excited to release Beta 2 for PixelOS 14. 

![PixelOS 14](https://github.com/PixelOS-Releases/banners/blob/fourteen/pixelos-alt.png?raw=true)

We've added back most of the features that we had on PixelOS 13 with a few exceptions which will be added back in the coming updates.
December Patch has been merged in the sources, available at https://github.com/PixelOS-Fourteen/.

Stay tuned for further updates and device-specific changelogs as the beta rolls out for supported devices.

Thanks for being part of PixelOS. We're looking forward to what's next with Android 14. Stay tuned for more updates!
