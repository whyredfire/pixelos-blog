## Greetings, PixelOS community!
As 2023 draws to an end, we are excited to unveil – PixelOS 14 stable, based on QPR1.
The December patch has been merged, available at https://github.com/PixelOS-Fourteen/.

We almost have feature parity with our Android 13 builds, with the rest of the missing features coming in future builds.

## Important Update:
Recently Google has been taking a proactive approach to blocking fingerprints used to pass Play Protect checks. 
After trying to work around this, we've decided on a more user friendly approach of having the props in an overlay. 
This means it can be updated more seamlessly without the need to wait for updates every time a fingerprint is blocked.

## Feature Additions:
        - Ability to disable QS battery estimates
        - Ability to hide power menu on lock screen
        - Ability to secure tiles from lock screen
        - Added package name to installed app details
        - Double tap to trigger doze
        - Face Unlock from Paranoid Android
        - High touch polling rate*
        - Lineage Health Service*
        - LiveDisplay Feature
        - One shot AutoBrightness

        * Feature availability is contingent on maintainer opt-in and device compatibility

## The new clock faces from QPR1 have also been added
