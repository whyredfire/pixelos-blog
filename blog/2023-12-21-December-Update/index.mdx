## Greetings, PixelOS community!
As the curtains draw to a close on 2023, we are excited to unveil – PixelOS 14 stable, based on QPR1.
We've added back most of the features that we had on PixelOS 13 with a few exceptions which will be added back in the coming updates.
December Patch has been merged in the sources, available at https://github.com/PixelOS-Fourteen/.

**Important Update:**
In the backdrop of recent developments, Google has been swift in banning the fingerprints we were utilizing. We have transitioned to a modular approach. Certified props are now stored in an overlay, allowing for seamless updates without the need to re-flash the entire ROM. This marks a significant shift, ensuring a smoother experience for our users.

**Feature Additions:**
        - Ability to disable QS battery estimates
        - Ability to hide power menu on lock screen
        - Ability to secure tiles from lock screen
        - Added package name to installed app details
        - Double tap to trigger doze
        - Face Unlock from Paranoid Android
        - High touch polling rate*
        - Lineage Health Service*
        - LiveDisplay Feature
        - One shot AutoBrightness

        * Feature availability is contingent on maintainer opt-in and device compatibility

## We've also added new clock faces
