Greetings, PixelOS community!
As the curtains draw to a close on 2023, we are excited to unveil – PixelOS 14 stable, based on QPR1.
We've added back most of the features that we had on PixelOS 13 with a few exceptions which will be added back in the coming updates.
December Patch has been merged in the sources, available at https://github.com/PixelOS-Fourteen/.

**Important Update:**
In the backdrop of recent developments, Google has been swift in banning the fingerprints we were utilizing. We have transitioned to a modular approach. Certified props are now stored in an overlay, allowing for seamless updates without the need to re-flash the entire ROM. This marks a significant shift, ensuring a smoother experience for our users.

**Feature Additions:**
        - Ability to disable QS battery estimates
        - Ability to hide power menu on lock screen
        - Ability to secure tiles from lock screen
        - Added package name to installed app details
        - Double tap to trigger doze
        - Face Unlock from Paranoid Android
        - High touch polling rate*
        - Lineage Health Service*
        - LiveDisplay Feature
        - One shot AutoBrightness

        * Feature availability is contingent on maintainer opt-in and device compatibility

We've also added new clock faces

Stay tuned for further updates and device-specific changelogs as the update rolls out for supported devices.

We would also like to thank those who have been translating PixelOS into different languages for their contributions as they've been a great help. 
If you've noticed anything that isn't translated in a language you speak, please consider helping out with the translations at translate.pixelos.org

Thanks for being part of PixelOS. We're looking forward to what's next with Android 14.
