Hello community! We're excited to release Beta 2 for PixelOS 14. 

![PixelOS 14](https://github.com/PixelOS-Releases/banners/blob/fourteen/pixelos-alt.png?raw=true)

We've added back most of the features that we had on PixelOS 13 with a few exceptions which will be added back in the coming updates.
December Patch has been merged in the sources, available at https://github.com/PixelOS-Fourteen/.

Stay tuned for further updates and device-specific changelogs as the beta rolls out for supported devices.

We would also like to thank those who have been translating PixelOS into different languages for their contributions as they've been a great help. 
If you've noticed anything that isn't translated in a language you speak, please consider helping out with the translations at translate.pixelos.org

Thanks for being part of PixelOS. We're looking forward to what's next with Android 14.

The PixelOS Team
