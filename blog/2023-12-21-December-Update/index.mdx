Hello community! We're excited to release PixelOS 14 stable. 

![PixelOS 14](https://github.com/PixelOS-Releases/banners/blob/fourteen/pixelos-alt.png?raw=true)

We've added back most of the features that we had on PixelOS 13 with a few exceptions which will be added back in the coming updates.
December Patch has been merged in the sources, available at https://github.com/PixelOS-Fourteen/.

Feature Additions:
                - Ability to disable QS battery estimates
                - Ability to hide power menu on lock screen
                - Ability to secure tiles from lock screen
                - Added package name to installed app details
                - Double tap to trigger doze
                - Face Unlock from Paranoid Android
                - High touch polling rate*
                - Lineage Health Service*
                - LiveDisplay Feature
                - One shot AutoBrightness

        * Feature availability is contingent on maintainer opt-in and device compatibility

Stay tuned for further updates and device-specific changelogs as the update rolls out for supported devices.

We would also like to thank those who have been translating PixelOS into different languages for their contributions as they've been a great help. 
If you've noticed anything that isn't translated in a language you speak, please consider helping out with the translations at translate.pixelos.org

Thanks for being part of PixelOS. We're looking forward to what's next with Android 14.
