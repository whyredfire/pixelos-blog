As we announce the release of our latest version today, we reflect on the journey that brought us here. 
PixelOS started about two and a half years ago as a fork of PixelExperience and we can't thank them enough for making us possible. 
We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the PixelExperience team for providing the foundation that allowed us to grow and evolve.
We wish Jhenrique all the best on his future endeavors.

### Support PixelOS's Development
We're immensely grateful for the ongoing support from our incredible community. 
While we haven't quite reached our donation goal, we see a fantastic opportunity for our users to make a more meaningful impact. 
Instead of contributing via PayPal, we invite you to consider sponsoring us on GitHub [here](https://github.com/sponsors/PixelOS-AOSP). 
By doing so, you're not only helping us meet our financial targets but also directing your support towards PixelOS's growth without adding to PayPal's bottom line.

A heartfelt thank you to our current sponsors: LobodPl, hiram2024, attdin22, ihyoudou, Sureshgorai25 and Mainak009. 

Thanks for being part of PixelOS.
