Hello everyone, a lot has happened since our last update, especially with Play Integrity. Builds are now required to be signed, and we have implemented this change. While you won't be able to update via OTA, you should be able to update (dirty flash) over the previous May build via sideload. We bring this quick update towards the end of May as we understand Play Integrity is extremely important to you all. This will be our last update based on Android 14 QPR2 as QPR3 is around the corner.
