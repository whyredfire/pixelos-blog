Errors..issues..fixes..more errors..more and more isssues..testing, last two weeks has been harsh on us. I am sure some of y'all have been noticing our CI channel, we have been building Pre-Release builds since long, but things took more time than we expected. 

Anyways, After almost a couple of weeks of "[Soon](https://twitter.com/PixelOSROM/status/1577313222956388361?s=20&t=FnLXxhY0lh5JDtR3fEiSKg)" we are finally are ready to present the October update of PixelOS [Comes with the patch level `2022-10-05`], with this, PixelOS Android 13 is officially out of Beta. We needed that delay to work out a stuff to change the "Beta" to "Stable". What does this mean? Nothing. They are just version names, previous "beta" (if not stable) was pretty stable for most devices. 

At last, for those who ask "wen updoot sar?????", it will roll out within few days from now, depending on maintainers. We hope to finish off all supported devices before the month ends.
