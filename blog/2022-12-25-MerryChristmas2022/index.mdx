This year has been a rollercoaster, with many ups and downs, but Christmas is a time to forget those hard turns and congregate to find 
joy in the little things. Whether it's spending time with family, exchanging gifts, or simply enjoying the holiday spirit, there are so 
many ways to celebrate the season.

May your Christmas be filled with love, laughter, and all the things that bring you happiness. May it be a time of reflection, gratitude, 
and hope for a bright future.

## The year 2022

As the year 2022 comes to a close, we at PixelOS would like to reflect on the past year and share some updates with our community.

In 2022, PixelOS underwent a significant transformation, evolving from a small project with limited scope and structure to a more 
expansive and well-organized endeavour. While the name remained the same, virtually everything else changed, including the team members, 
the addition of a website, automation processes, and blog pages, and the decision to base our work on AOSP for Android 13. It was a year 
of growth and development for PixelOS, and we are proud of the progress we have made.

We are thrilled to report that PixelOS has seen tremendous growth in downloads and website traffic this year compared to previous years. 
We have had well over 4 lakh downloads (we started to properly count downloads well during the tail end of the year, actual figure must have been 
higher), and our website has seen almost 40,000 weekly visits (not including traffic to our blog page)

We are also proud to announce that PixelOS is now actively supporting 27 devices across 6 different brands, including Asus, Micromax, 
Motorola, OnePlus, Realme, and Xiaomi. We are grateful to be able to serve such a wide range of devices.

Finally, we want to give a special shoutout to our growing Telegram community, which is now over 5.4k members strong. Your support and engagement 
have been integral to our success, and we are grateful for your ongoing involvement in the PixelOS community.

Overall, 2022 has been a fantastic year for PixelOS, and we are excited to see what the future holds. While we are proud of our accomplishments, 
we also recognize that there is always room for improvement and growth.

We want to take this opportunity to thank all of our users, supporters, and community members for your continued loyalty and engagement. 
We couldn't have made it this far without you, and we look forward to continuing this growth in 2023.


## What about the December 2022 update?

understand that you may be looking forward to these updates, 
and we appreciate your patience as we resolve any issues and get everything back on track. 
Be sure to keep an eye on our update channel for updates on the status of our releases. 

We can't wait to share what we've been working on with you. We wish you 
and your loved ones a Merry Christmas and a happy and healthy new year! See you in 2023, with a new update of PixelOS!
