Errors..issues..fixes..more errors..more and more isssues..testing, last two weeks has been harsh on us. I am sure some of y'all have been noticing our CI channel, we have been building Pre-Release builds since long, but things took more time than we expected. 

## The "Stable" Release 

Anyways, After almost a couple of weeks of "[Soon](https://twitter.com/PixelOSROM/status/1577313222956388361?s=20&t=FnLXxhY0lh5JDtR3fEiSKg)" we are finally are ready to present the October update of PixelOS [Comes with the patch level `2022-10-05`], with this, PixelOS Android 13 is officially out of Beta. We needed that delay to work out a stuff to change the "Beta" to "Stable". What does this mean? Nothing. They are just version names, previous "beta" (if not stable) was pretty stable for most devices. 

:::danger

Since we have a **lot** of changes moving from Beta to Stable, we recommend that every perform a clean flash to update to this version. 

Support will not be given to those who dirty flash
